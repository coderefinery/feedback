many thanks for organizing the workshop, I really appreciated it and learnt a
lot! I will look forward to share my knowledge with colleagues in the future
and recommend your workshop (or come back as exercise leader once I'm more
experienced)

---

Thanks a lot for the fantastic workshop.

---

Thanks a ton for a very informative and useful workshop!

---

Many thanks to all the Code Refinery team for organizing a very good workshop

First of all thanks a lot for organizing and conducting the coderefinery
workshops! I learned a lot and I think I will be able to improve the quality of
my research applying the learned skills.

Thanks a lot for your work and the nice discussions!

---

I would like to thank you for this wonderful and very useful workshop.

Looking forward to the next workshops.

---

Thank you for a very engaging and informative workshop. I really enjoyed and
learned a lot at the same time.

Looking forward to more endeavors from your team.

---

I attended all the sessions of the workshop. It was wonderful. I would like to
say thank you very much for this great workshop. I really learned a lot, and I
will definitely use what I learned from the workshop into my work. I wish your
Coderefinery to be sustainable, long-lasting success.

Thanks again for the workshop! I really learned a lot and especially the first
week was really helpful for me.

---

Thank you very much for a very interesting and useful workshop. I really
appreciate the time and effort you dedicate to make this learning experience
very effective and relevant. I am bringing home a lot of useful material and
new insights that will definitely improve the quality of my work.

Thank you for six great days of learning Git, testing, modular code, Sphinx (!)
and more. I already started incorporating Sphinx in my current project.

---

I would like to congratulate you on the amazing workshop that you created.

---

It was a pleasure to attend the workshop as an Exercise Lead. I got to learn more than what I actually taught others.

---

It was very useful for my research career specially the modular and testing part was very interesting.

---

Thank you for organizing such a wonderful course. I learned a lot and truly appreciate your efforts.

---

Thank you for a great workshop! It was very insightful and worked surprisingly well with the online format.

---

Thank you for an amazing workshop.

---

Thank you all for this very helpful workshop,
it has been the most clear and useful workshop I followed in my 10 year career
in research.

---

Thank you for this great workshop. I learned a lot of things I am about to use!

---

Thanks for the wonderful workshop.

I attended the workshop as exercise leader and with a very small team with master and PhD students from computational chemistry/cheminformatics study plans. The workshop was very useful both to me and my students: we have learned a lot, and we did so in a gentle yet engaging way. The format of the workshop was a good balance of excellent online material, interactive co-teaching with good instructors, and the possibility to do collaborative work and discuss about lecture content and the exercises in the breakout rooms.
As for content, the workshop has offered the opportunity to fill a gap in the teaching portfolio of study projects that heavily involve data-handling, scripting and coding even if not directly marked as pertaining to any informatics curriculum. In fact, all of the topic covered by the workshop are beyond the material of the current study plans (in chemistry and nanosciences, at least in my institution) and, therefore, would have required quite a bit of tedious self-teaching, on the students side (which most often means, it is simply overlooked) and time-consuming assistance and explanations, on the supervisor side. I therefore consider the Coderefinery workshop a necessary technical training that complements the field-specific background built in the official study plans. I will definitely recommend the Coredefinery workshops to master and PhD students that are at the beginning of any project involving data analysis and even minimal extent of coding.

For the next time, Iâ€™d possibly try to place the May2021 workshop a few weeks after a preliminary crash-course on python, for those students that need a fresh start/reminder/update.

Though mine is just a tiny drop in the see, please, feel free to use my endorsement in founding applications.

Thanks a lot for the wonderful workshops. Here are my answers to the questionnaire.

* How did it go in your breakoutroom?
    * Anything that went particularly well?
    * Anything that did not work at all?
    * Any nice discussion topics that came up?
In general, I think it did go very well. We used the setup where we took turns in sharing the screen and doing the exercise.
In some occasions we were a bit under the pressure in finishing the exercise, but I guess this is a bit the nature of the course where the idea is covering a lot of ground in a very short time to give an overview of the whole picture (version control, documentation, testing, modular development etc ...).
It is a lot of material in a short time for people that do not have much experience, but I am convinced that it is the way to go if 6 half days is the time available.
Providing the whole picture really shows the importance of integrating these tools in our daily workflow to make reproducible science.

* Any exercises that need instruction improvements?
    * You can answer here or also directly add an issue to the lesson repository on our github account https://github.com/coderefinery
Not that I noticed

* Anything else you would like us to know?
I would like you to know that in my opinion, this course is gold!
I wish I had this when I was a Ph.D student!

Here follows some feedback from me. I added some points which I think could be interesting for you to have as context as well.

* Some context: I work as an RSE. I signed up as an exercise leader and told my colleagues to join in as team members at the section of Meteorology and Oceanography at the University of Oslo, Norway. For some of the students, I think it was a little problem that they got the confirmation e-mails too late and then had made other plans for the actual days. I think it was 10 participants in my team, but only 6 of them as stable participants for each lesson. That also made a little back and forth between dividing our team in two or not in the breakout room(s) which made a lot more logic for you as organizers (I assume). Maybe it will help to give a very fast reply when people sign-up and then ask for a new confirmation the week before. I do not know. It is a pity that some people sign-up without notifying us when they do not come after all.

* How did it go in your breakoutroom?
  - I think signing up with a team which consists of your colleagues with similar backgrounds is super for having a targeted discussion of the content towards day-to-day tasks that the learner experience in her/his usual working life.

  * Anything that went particularly well?
      - Discussion of the lesson material in the context which was relevant for the models/codes that are commonly used in meteorology (the common field of study of my team) was very useful.

  * Anything that did not work at all?
      - Even though people knew each other they spent a lot of time "warming up" before they started having discussions. I think this is common (especially in Norway) and I guess you already know this as well.

  * Any nice discussion topics that came up?
        - One of my personal tips which we discussed a little in the breakout rooms was the use of a modern editor with syntax highlighting, ssh-to-remote, and git integration. We are actually doing a little post-workshop about this subject in my team this week. I totally understand that you do not wish to enforce a choice of editor for the participants during the workshop, but I think that some of the learners that are beginners to for instance version control, will think that plain Nano without any extras is how a lot of people work. Which I think is wrong, but again this is only my impression. I'm thinking about a modern editor as a tool you use to force yourself to make the right choices as a default, for instance, awareness of snake vs. camel naming convention. I also realize that this is a subject that might not fit under the "beginner" label for software. Maybe it would make sense to host a "Research Software Hour" with this as a topic? I think the live-coding session hosted by Anne and Radovan was extremely useful for seeing what we learned in practice. 12 points for including this lesson in the workshop!!

* Any exercises that need instruction improvements?
  * You can answer here or also directly add an issue to the lesson repository on our github account https://github.com/coderefinery
    - We noticed that some instructions were a bit outdated with older git commands. I will add these points as issues in the respective repos instead of listing them up here.

* Anything else you would like us to know?
    - I would say that the kind of workshop CodeRefinery offers is an arena that makes my job as an RSE easier. I can say, join my team on this workshop instead of giving a one-to-one person lesson about how to use version control or sending a guide, which is neither efficient nor pedagogical, is a huge time saver for me. With the principle of "good enough software engineering practices" and "no stupid questions"-attitudes, you are really promoting an open and caring environment for all participants where participants on all levels can learn something new. I know that this kind of workshop is precisely one way we can help scientists that work with software to do better science. Even though the workshop is too long for a participant to remember in detail all that we go through I think it is extremely useful to have the material as a reference for later.

* Anything that you would have liked to get to know about in the onboarding or anything that was too much info there?
    - Excellent onboarding. I really enjoyed that you set up a session for exercise leaders before the workshop so we had time to ask questions directly to you.

Finally, thank you for an excellent workshop-hosting! It was really fun to learn together with my team and the rest of the workshop participants :D

Feel free to use my feedback as you please. I really hope that CodeRefinery could continue to live forever, with funding so the project is scalable and sustainable for its contributors!

Again, thanks for the wonderful workshop- one of the best formats Iâ€™ve come across. I advertised it to all my colleagues J Iâ€™ll definitely look into volunteering in the future code refineries.

The breakout rooms went very smooth. I started the workshop as an expert helper (EH) supporting a first time exercise leader (EL). The EL handled everything extremely well - so well in fact that I could act as an EH elsewhere. This was a nice construction both for new EL and new EH to get more comfortable in their roles.
The group itself was all made up of solo learners. We encouraged collaboration, discussion and screen sharing, but the group preferred to work independently. This is of course fine, but made it a little bit difficult to get discussions going in collaborative exercises. To help with this, we again encouraged screen sharing, and tried to be inclusive. What also helped was to start with casual discussion/ice breakers at the start of every day, or even exercise.

Other feedback has been provided in zulip and at github.

Thank you for another great CodeRefinery workshop - hope to see you next time!

It was very informative and useful for my research. Many elements I am trying to implement in my daily work now.
